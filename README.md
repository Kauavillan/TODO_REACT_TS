This is my very firs project using TypeScript. It was developed during my [TypeScript course at Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-do-basico-ao-avancado-c-react-express/), in which I did some changes in comparison to the original one, but it is basically just to train and learn more about the language. It's just the first of many projects I'm gonna develop with that language. Trust me!
